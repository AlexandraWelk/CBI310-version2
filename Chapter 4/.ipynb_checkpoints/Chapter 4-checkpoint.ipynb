You should realise how the tree of life represents a timeline of evolutionary development. The following interactive chart will give you an idea, try and develop a feeling for the chart with special emphasis on the initial split points between bacteria, archea and eukaryotes. Try and play with the map to determine the common ancestors of two vastly different species. When for example did humans split from mushrooms (fungi)ðŸ˜ƒ?\n",

    "Now that we have an bit of chemical engineering understanding on food crop agriculture it is time to have a look at annimals or livestock. Most humans prefer to have meat as part of their diet and accordingly an additional processing step have to be included after the fotosynthesis process before the humans can have their food. Important to understand that annimals requires food from plants similar to humans. It all start with the [autotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph) before the [heterotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph)can eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important question to answer is whether meat from annimals is required in the human diet. Meat adds a of flavour to food, but vegetarians will argue that it is not a requirement in the human diet. Off course vegetarians still consume eggs and milk and thus livestock farming is still required to some extend. Only vegans live on plant based food only and they will argue that they get all the nutrition required for human health. Have a look at the following video and develop your own opinion on the statements used. We'll have a short discussion in class on the video.\n",

In addition we'll add ther following crop(?) to the chicken diet. For this calculation we'll have to perform two consecutive mass balances, fisrst the ....\n"
