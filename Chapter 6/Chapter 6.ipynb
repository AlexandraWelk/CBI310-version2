    "In this chapter we are going to model a batch AD reactor. The complex process of AD will be simplified to the following 2 reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S→X+CH_4+CO_2+NH3+H_2O+R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation the biomass feed to the digester will be referred to as substrate (or $S$). The biomass that grows on the substrate ($X$) consist of varius organisms that performs hydrolysis, acedogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenosis. Note that we will only work with final products and ignore intermediates like amino acids, sugar monomers and fatty acids. The recalcitrant ($R$) fraction represents the biomass that can't be digested by the microbes and gives another product. The following second reaction will also occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X→CH_4+CO_2+NH3+H_2O$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction represents the decomposition of bacterial biomass that has formed in the first reaction. These bacterial cells can fully decompose without leaving a recalcitrant fraction behind. Let's start with the CHON matices of these two reactions: "
