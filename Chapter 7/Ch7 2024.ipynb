    "Class, meet your CLB321 anaerobic digester. This digester was named BABY1 and we will hence refer to this name. We have 3 CSC students (Matthew, Ane, and Nkutu), 1 Hons student (Mfundo) and 1 M.Eng student (Caela -you might know her) working full-time on the development of BABY1. You and your group will be taking care of BABY1 for 6 weeks in the second semester if you enroll for CLB321. BABY1 has a 10L liquid capacity and a 10L gas capacity. BABY1 also comes with a gas capture device where the biogas flow rate can be accurately measured. The digester can be operated in batch and continuous mode. You will note that the container is a mere polyethylene plastic tube. To give you an indication of size, the wooden cradle length is 1m and the width 25cm. The picture above contains only water and no substrate or microbial cells. We are still sorting out leaking and other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 6 we have developed tools to look at AD from a fundamental angle. Let's now explore the practical side by using BABY1 as our digester. The objective for BABY1 is to operate continuosly while only using organic food waste as feed. In order to get to this state we will have to start with a batch process where AD microbes are added in combination with substrate. We have two available substrates, cowdung and foodwaste, and only cowdung contains the microbes that will drive the digestion. By growing these organism we want to retain them in the digester and therefore continuous operation is our current best idea. So cowdung will only be used during startup to innoculate the microbial cultures required for digestion.\n",

    "The term **TS** stands for total solids and refers to the dry content that remains after drying at 80C. The C:N ratio is from an elemental analysis on the dry matter and be directly related to the C:N ratio in cmol:mol used in our mass balances. For AD we want the total solids concentration to be between 50 and 100 g/kg mixture (5 to 10%). Let's say that 50% of the solids must be from cowdung and the other 50% from food waste.\n",
