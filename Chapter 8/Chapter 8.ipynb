    "By now you should have an idea of the food chain, how it is produced, how it is consumed and how waste from the process can be used to generate energy. This course has a biochemical engineering focus and accordingly we get a bit deeper into how micro-organisms or microbes are part of the food chain. As chemical engineers it is imperative to understand how microbes can be utilised to process product streams from the food chain. In the previous two chapters we have considered the processing of manure, foodwaste and non-edible plant material. It is important to understand that a major fraction of the nutrients from the food chain ends up in water, just think of what you flush down daily in the toilet. In this regard it is important to understand how microbes can assist in cleaning the water. Have a look at a generic outlay of a wastewater plant:\n",

    "\n",
    "You will see that the intial steps of wastewater treatment entails the removal of solids from the wastewater and that the collected solids are fed to an anaerobic digestion unit in order to generate energy. Once solids are removed there is still a lot of dissolved organics in the water and microbes are required to process these chemicals. Our focus in this chapter will mainly be on the biological treatment of the solid-lean water, where aerobic organisms are used to digest the nutrients. We can talk about aerobic digestion and approach the modeling in a very similar manner than before. The main difference will be the aeration required to supply the organisms with oxygen. To purify the water, carbon, nitrogen and minerals (especially phosphorous) have to be removed. Since the process is aerobic carbon can be metabolised to $CO_2$ that will escape as a gas. Nitrogen still has to be released from its organic state to form $NH_3$. There will also be a lot of $NH_3$ in the water from urine. In standard wastewater terminlogy the term **secondary wastewater treatment** is used to describe the biological processes. These processes can occur in multiple vessels and apart from removing carbon to $CO_2$, nitrogen is typically removed as $N_2$. The processes of converting $NH_3$ to $N_2$ is referred to as nitrification and denitrification, the latter being an anaerobic process. Note that minerals will be removed via live microbes referred to as **sludge**. Sludge can be fed to anaerobic digesters to decrease the carbon content and to free the nitrogen and minerals contained within the sludge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will only look at carbon removal and $NH_3$ production from dissolved organic matter. We will work exclusively with continous processes since this is the standard mode of operation. Before we get into the modeling we'll look at standard measuring techniques to quantify the quality of wastewater. "

    "Looking at the fifth row we see the energy balance. You will see that the $\\gamma$ value of 2.5 $\\frac{mol \\, ATP}{cmol \\, X }$ is higher than the anaerobic value of 1.8 $\\frac{mol \\, ATP}{cmol \\, X }$. This is becuase ATP is far more avaialble in a aerobic system and accordingly the organism is less efficient in conserving ATP. Remember from chapter 1 that we got 21 ATP from a mole of glucose, this will translate to 3.5 mol ATP per cmol of glucose. Compare this to the amount of ATP obtained in lactic acid (anaerobic) fermentation where only 2 ATPs are obtained per mole of glucose (or $\\frac{1}{3}$ mol ATP per cmol of glucose). In this example we will assume that the breakdown of the organic to pyruvic acid will entail the use of ATP and accordingly we'll generate 2.5 mole of ATP per oxygen consumed. Note that we use the oxygen stream to assign the ATP generation rather than the substrate. This makes sense since it is easier to relate ATP generation with oxygen (remember the P/O ratios in chapter 1).\n",

The saturated oxygen concentration is dependent on the oxygen partial pressure and typically varies between $6-8 \\frac{mg}{L}$ (1.9e-4 to 2.5e-4 $\\frac{mol\\,O_2}{L}$) at atmospheric air conditions The chemical engineering approach is to assume that all liquid on the gas-liquid interface (edge of bubbles) are saturated (at $C_{O}^{sat}$ ) while $C_{O}$ will always be less than $C_{O}^{sat}$. The mass transfer coefficient (note the units) is determined by the air flowrate, sparger and impeller characteristics but will be supplied in this course."

    "We will start our modeling with a batch system. In this system the microbial biomass will grow and $C_X$ will increase. With an increase in $C_X$ the demand for oxygen will increase since both energy drivers ($\\theta$ and $\\mu$) derives energy from using energy. A situation will develop where the amount of oxygen that can be supplied via mass transfer ($kla(C_o^{sat}-C_o)$) will determine the amount of growth and maintenance that cells can obtain. Each cell requires a minimum maintenance amount to sustain itself and this value tends to be close to $\\theta_{max}$. If $\\theta$ drops below this amount the cells in an oxygenated system struggle to maintain themself. To model this requirement we first need to look at the governing rate equations:\n",
