    "Hopefully it reminds you of the respiration videos in chapter 1. We won't be getting into metabolic detail of the process of photosyntheis, but it is very interesting to note that photosyntheis is really the reverse reaction of aerobic respiration. But more about this later. Let's rather look at the picture above a bit more. Can you see the phospholipids that constitutes the membrane? Do you know the chemical composition of this membrane? There is a lot of 'insertions' in the membrane. These are all spesialised proteins that facilitate the process of capturing sunlight and turning it into ATP. We are not going deep into the mechanism of this process, we are rather interested into how these specialised proteins are made. The short answer to this question is that DNA contains the recipes to produce all the proteins that the organims requires, this is referred to as the central dogma of biology. Before we can understand the dogma we nee some background on nucluic acids:\n",

    "As chemical engineers we are interested in speed of transcription and translation. _E.coli_ can achieve transcription rates of 60 nucleotides per second with the corresponding translation rate of 20 amino acids per second. So an average gene on 5000 base pairs will produce a full protein in 80 seconds. That is fast! "

    "So now we at least know how proteins get made and hopefully soon you will understand how the proteins responsible for fotosynthesis are absolutely essential for life on earth. The sun is the great energy source and fotosynthesis is the great capturer that converts light energy into chemical energy. Do you understand that all fossil fuels are derived fron ancient plant material? [Climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) is really a result of humans burning 'ancient sunlight'. It is highly unsustainable since the rate of $CO_2$ capture by 'current sunlight' is not nearly as fast as the release of $CO_2$ from 'ancient sunlight'. Ensure that you understand this principle. \n",

    "This implies that the energy driving your computer at the moment is effectively derived from sunlight. I guess this will make you appreciate the fotosyntheis proteins a bit more and also the amazing process of transcription and translation that keeps on producing new proteins so that we can keep on harvesting sunlight."

    "Very interesting. The theme of [endosymbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont) already discussed in chapter 1 is also occuring here where the cyanobacteria developed into the chloropast similar to the development of the mitochondria. The accumulation of oxygen into the atmosphere, caused by cyanobacteria is sometimes referred to as the [great oxygenation event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event). All eukaryotes basically developed because of oxygen availability. Once evolution discovered aerobic respiration the path was set for the the development of [multicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism), given that much bigger quantities of ATP could be generated with the avaialbility of oxygen. Of course, cyanobacteria preceded the invention of aerobic respiration because oxygen had to accumulate in the atmosphere first. \n",

    "We'll start with an oversimplified example and then extend the example to a real diet consisting of real foodcrops. For the first example our food product will be the same as the food digested in chapter 2. It is important to realise that edible biomass is always associated with non-edible plant material like the stems, leaves, roots etc. For this example we will assume that only 40% of all the plant material are edible and that the remaining 60% cannot be consumed. We will use the following CHON formula for the non-edible part of biomass produced:\n",
