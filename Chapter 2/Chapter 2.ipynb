We will also require oxygen as final electron acceptor from oxidative phosphorilation, so this is an additional stream into the process. When we consider the streams that exit the body (or system) it is obvious that COâ‚‚ must leave the system when we consider the formation of COâ‚‚ in the TCA cycle. In addition our food and liquid consumption generate a solid waste stream (feces) and a liquid waste stream (urine). Since we will be working with annimal manure in the next chapters we prefer to use the term humanure for solid waste generated from humans, it just sounds better than all the other terms avaialble. There is of course other small excretion streams like sweat, tears, mucus and hair but the amount of chemicals contained in these excretions are relatively insignificant compared to the main streams mentioned above, so for keeping the mass balance simple we will ignore these terms.The following diagram will help:\n",

We already have the elemental composition of the food intake, but in order to complete the mass balance we need elemental compositions (and some flowrates) of the urine and humanure stream.

    "## Linear equations and the beauty of the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass balances\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the human metabolism. We eat proteins, carbohydrates and fat, we consume oxygen and we excrete urine, humanure and $CO_2$. We also excrete sweat, hair and other excretions but from a mass balance point of view these excretions are negligible. So let's get into the math of this chemical transformation. We can start by writing the overall chemical equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\cdot C H_{2}O+b \\cdot  C H_{2}O_{0.11}+c \\cdot H_{1.6}O_{0.32}N_{0.26}+d \\cdot O_2â†’e \\cdot CO_2+f \\cdot C H_{4}O_1N_2+g \\cdot CH_{1.75}O_{0.59}N_{0.125}+ h \\cdot H_2 O$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the formulas for carbs, fat and protein already given above. $a$-$g$ merely presents the stoichiometric coeffisients of the single equations. Obtaining these stoicheometric coeffisients is the name of the CBI game. If we know these coeffisients we can relate the rate of formation/consumption of one component to any of the other components. So if one rate is known, let's say the rate of carb consumption, all other rates are known because the stoicheometry is established. If we know the rates of all components the problem is solved. Important to undestand that the $a$-$g$ values are relative and not absolute values. The typical convention is to make $a=1$ and then relate $b$-$g$ to the chosen value of $a$. In this course we will choose one of the $a$-$g$ values as the rate of that component and since the $a$-$g$ values are mere ratios of the component rates, the rates of each component will be easy to calculate. More on this later. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is funny about the above equation is that a single carbon is used in all the formulas. This is called the **cmol concept** and you need to fully grasp this concept for the rest of CBI. If you think about all the carb molecules entering the body you should understand that some will contain more carbon atoms in the chain than others. Sugar will only contain 12 carbon atoms, but some starches will contain hundreds of carbon atoms chained together. These different molecules do however share a constant ratio between carbon and hydrogen atoms, also between carbon and oxygen atoms. So since we can't define the exact carb molecule entering the body, we opt for defining a molecule with only one carbon. We then perform all our rate  (stoicheometry) calculations on the basis of this molecule with only one carbon. This is the essence of the cmol concept. You will learn the concept as we do more exersizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important when we define stoicheometric coeffisients ($a$-$g$) to consider the sign of the coeffisient. The convention is to use a negative sign for consumption and a positive sign for production. At times we won't be sure if a certain component (like water) is a product or a reactant and then the calculation will show us the answer via the sign of the value calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "So can you balance the above equation like you did in high school? Give it a try. You might realise that the problem is under specified, implying that mere atom balancing won't give you an answer. There is only four chemical elements in the equation above and 8 components, so we need more than atomic mass balances to solve for the stoicheometry (rates).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is 8 stoicheometric coeffisients to solve for, so we need 8 equations to perform the job. Let's start with the mass balances, they are fairly straightfoward. Stoicheometric coeffisients are typically relative, as mentioned before, but in CBI we'll make them absolute by making the coeffisient the rate of that specific component, thus:\n",
