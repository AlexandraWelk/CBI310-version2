We will be considering minerals in this design but only phosphorous and sodium as these give a good representation of the other minerals. It will be important to have a $P$ and $Na$ stream in each of the stoicheometric tables. Ultimately we really want to minimize the amount of $NH_3$, $P$ that we feed to the system. The fresh inlet water contains $Na$ which will hopefully supply all $Na$ to the system. Apart from minimizing minerals used, we also want to minimize the amount of water, $CO_2$ and oxygen that has to be supplied, since this will have to be shipped from earth. \n",

Assume that the solids in the liquid feed to unit 3 does not add to the volume of the total mixture (this implies that only water will determine the volumetric flowrate through unit 3). The volumetric rate of water through the system (Q3) can assumed to be constant and will stay constant as it progress to unit 4.You can assume that digestate is removed as dry biomass form the digester.

Your aerobic digester should be such that the amount of substrate that leaves the digester is less than 400 $\\frac{mg}{L}$.The aerobic microbial biomass X4 (or S4) is refeerd to as sludge and will be recycled back to unit 3. You can assume that the sludge will be dried when recycled back to unit 3. The organic carbon and nitrogen still present in the remaining substrate (less than 400 $\\frac{mg}{L}$) will be decomposed by micobes on the plant roots to $CO_2$ and $NH_3$. For your calculation you can assume that the decomposition occurs before L4 is fed to the water tank (unit 5), implying that the concentration of $NH3$, $P$ and $Na$ will be slightly higher that the direct outlet from the aerobic digester.

Note that you will have to feed at least the amount of **N and P** that leaves the system as solid digestate (S5).

Once this is done you will have to repeat the mass balance over unit 5 to determine a new composition of L5. Python has to keep repeating the calculation until the concentrations of **NH3,P,Na** stabilise. Define an error as the square of the difference between old and new values for the concentration in unit 5 and set this error to 1e-10 when using molar concentrations. Use the **while error > 1e-10:** statement for the loop to converge.\n",
